                            I am a full stack software developer currently working at BaritechSol which provides services to "Auctane" a U.S-based company that provides internet-based mailing and shipping services to e-commerce businesses.
                            With over 1 year of professional experience in software development, specializing in web development, I offer expertise in creating responsive, high-performance websites using modern technologies like React, .NET, and SQL Server, microservices architecture and REST APIs. Whether you need a new web application built from scratch or improvements to an existing one, I am committed to delivering clean, efficient code and outstanding results tailored to your business needs.
